                    Hey, I'm Nicolas Caraballo, I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science at the University of South Carolina! I love to combine the creative and logical sides of my personality to create things that can make people's lives a little bit more enjoyable. I have a special interest in game/software development, and would like to act as part of a team of developers. Outside of that, I enjoy theater and scuba diving.

                        A posterboard-style depiction of various issues/topics that will need adressing as the project goes on. There are various secions adressing potential solutions to the problem, problems, how I would have to support the project, how could the project actually be made, whether or not there are competition, and connecting points.
